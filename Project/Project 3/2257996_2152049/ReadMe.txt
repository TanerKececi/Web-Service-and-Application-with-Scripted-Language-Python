In this assignment we worked as a team. We have divided this assignment into two main parts. Doğukan Çatal was responsible 
of creating the Server and Ziya Taner Keçeci was responsible for creating Client.

For every functionality of program Doğukan and Taner worked sequentially. 
For example, Taner and Doğukan first wrote constructors and mains to create network connections and made sure the connection was created successfully.

After that Taner created loginButtonFrame and Doğukan wrote login method and tested the network connection for this frame. 
This sequence will be followed for the rest of the project.

We have communicated via Whatsapp and Discord.
