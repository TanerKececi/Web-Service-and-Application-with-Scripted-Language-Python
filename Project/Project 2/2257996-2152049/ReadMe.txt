In this assignment we worked as a team. We have divided this assignment into two main parts. Doğukan Çatal was responsible 
of creating the nested dictionary and Ziya Taner Keçeci was responsible for creating the menu and plotting the bar charts.
When Doğukan finished creating the nested dictionary he sent the assignment to Taner to create menu and plotting the bar charts.
We have communicated via Whatsapp and Discord. We tested our project by creating lots of nested dictionary until having the right one
and we also tested by creating lots of bar charts to see if the nested dictionary and bar charts match.
