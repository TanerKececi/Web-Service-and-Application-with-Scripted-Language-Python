In this assignment we worked as a team. Ziya Taner Keçeci was responsible for creating database.py, login.py, registration.py, homepage.html, loginpage.html, registrationpage.html. Doğukan Çatal was responsible for
creating createad.py, deletead.py, listad.py, applicationpage.html. listallad.py has been created by both Taner Keçeci and Doğukan Çatal. We have communicated via Whatsapp
and Discord. We have helped each other whenever someone was stuck with a problem on their part. Apart from individual
tests for responsible parts. We have tested the final application by collecting every file in Doğukan Çatal's pc and 
changed every first line where python location is given in files with extension of ".py" to make the application able 
to work on that pc.
